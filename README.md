# NLP Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling

---

This project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning to look at movie reviews and attempt to analyze them using these methods. Specifically, I wanted perform sentiment analysis on the reviews to gauge the overall positive or negative valence of the review and then perform topic modeling to see what topics are prominent for the negative reviews. 

The film I chose for this project was *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. There are a number of reasons why I settled on this film. First, Star Wars is a massive pop culture franchise, perhaps the largest in existence, so it is a film of great relevance for understanding popular opinion, and also there would be no shortage of data to work with. Second, The Last Jedi is objectively the most divisive Star Wars film ever. The original trilogy of films is generally universally liked by the fanbase and the "Prequel" film trilogy is generally disliked, but *The Last Jedi* has split fan opinion in two. The negative voices tend to be the loudest on social media and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+last+jedi+negative+review), but there is also a great deal of [positive support](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+last+jedi+positive+review) for the film as well, with many calling it their favorite Star Wars film. Never has opinion on a film in this franchise been so divided, so it felt like a good one for evaluating consumer opinion. 

With this in mind I first did sentiment analysis on reviews of *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* then performed topic modeling on the negative reviews to see what issues are of most concern to those who did not like the film.
